# Problem Statement
Our manufacturing company has several assembly lines with machines that work to create products we sell. In order to keep the assembly line humming, we have fitted the machiens with IoT sensors to monitor their health and perform both preventive and reactive maintenance.

Our team has been handed the responsibility to investigate if Machine Learning can be used to train models and use them to detect abnormal patterns that in turn could help us perform **Predictive Maintenance**.

To help us with creating a proof of concept called **TAR Predictor (TARP)**, we will use NASA's established repository with datasets to be used for benchmarking prognostics and predictive maintenance related algorithms. Among these datasets involves data from a turbofan engine simulation model C-MAPPS (or Commercial Modular Aero Propulsion System Simulation). 

# Endgoal
The endgoal of TARP is to train a model that will predict the **TTF** - Time To Failure and **RUL** - Remaining Useful Life.
